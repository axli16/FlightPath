## 2024-05-24 - [YOLO Post-Processing Loop Optimization]
**Learning:** In standard YOLO implementations (OpenCV/Darknet), the class confidence score is defined as `Objectness * ClassProbability`. Therefore, the final confidence for any class can never exceed the initial `Objectness` score (index 4). By adding a check `if (objectness <= threshold) continue;` at the start of the loop, we can skip the inner loop iterating over 80+ classes for the vast majority of "background" anchors.
**Action:** Always check for hierarchical probability relationships in nested loops. If an upper bound (like Objectness) is already below a threshold, skip the detailed probability calculations. This yielded a ~53x speedup in the post-processing loop benchmark.
